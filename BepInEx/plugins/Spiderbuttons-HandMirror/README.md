# HandMirror
Thanks to additional company training, you now know that if you hold a hand-mirror up, you can effectively look anywhere you want, just by changing* the angle of the mirror! Notably, this includes _behind_ you, where the coilheads are, stopping them dead in their tracks so long as you keep the mirror up and don't take a corner too tightly. Now you don't have to worry about walking backwards through the building to get homeâ€”so long as you can find a hand-mirror first, of course.
##
This mod renames the magnifying glass, which I never realized wasn't actually a hand-mirror at all until I started making this mod, and provides it with extra anti-coilhead technology. Scrap values and spawn chances were unchanged, so it'll still be up to luck whether you find one when looting, and up to you whether it's worth selling for quota when you do.
### Future Plans:
- Actually making the mirror reflective, maybe.
