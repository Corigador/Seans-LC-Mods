# An0n Patches
Crouch Jump, HP and Sprint numbers in the HUD, and all around better movement.  

# Features
* HP and Stamina numbers in HUD.
* Instant Sprint speed, no more slow build up 
* Instant jump, no delay.
* No slipperiness when turning at sprint speeds
* Crouch Jump!
* Hold CTRL to Crouch - No more crouch toggle.

Instant Sprint speed, slipperiness, Instant Jump, and the HP/Sprint hud can all be configured.

Todo: No config to turn off crouch jump/hold since it's a bit messy.
