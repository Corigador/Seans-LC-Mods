A new moon based on the game SCP:Secret Lab and located on the facility Site-02. 
"An abandoned lab once known as Site-02. Proceed with caution, entities once contained here now roam its halls."

If you want to enable SCP Dungeon Generation on Secret Labs moon simply add ```secret labs``` to the FoundationMoonsList config entry on the SCP Dungeon Generation mod. Please note there is incompatibility issues with multiplayer and will not work.

PKY has taken over the scrap mod, that will now have all the [custom scrap](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/PKY/SCP_scrap/) added in that mod to be able to spawn in all maps.

Check out my other [custom moon](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zingar/Atlas_Abyss/).
